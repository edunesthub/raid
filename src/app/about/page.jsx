      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Raid Arena League - A New Era of Competitive Mobile Gaming in Africa</h2>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">The Raid Arena League is a structured, seasonal competition designed to bring together Africa's most passionate mobile gamers under one exciting and organized system. Unlike regular tournaments that end after a few matches, the league format offers a continuous journey — where players compete, improve, and climb through divisions over weeks of thrilling matchups.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">At its core, the Raid Arena League is about consistency, dedication, and fair competition. It rewards not only single victories but the determination to perform well over time. Each player or team battles opponents in their division, earning points for wins and draws. As matches progress, the leaderboard reflects their standings, creating a transparent and engaging experience that keeps everyone motivated.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">League Structure</h3>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Every season of the Raid Arena League is carefully planned around popular mobile games such as Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG Mobile, FIFA Mobile, and Mobile Legends. Each game has its own dedicated league, ensuring fair and balanced competition tailored to that specific title.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Players begin the season by registering in their preferred game's league. Once registration closes, they are placed into divisions such as Bronze, Silver, or Gold, depending on their skill level or past performance. These divisions make the competition fairer — new players compete with other newcomers, while experienced players face tougher opponents.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Throughout the season, participants play scheduled matches against others in their division. For every victory, they earn three points, for a draw one point, and none for a loss. The standings are updated after every match, allowing players to track their progress and see how close they are to the top.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">At the end of the season, the top-ranked players or teams from each division are promoted to higher leagues, while lower-ranked ones may be relegated. This constant movement keeps the system competitive, dynamic, and exciting — ensuring that every match matters.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Seasonal Flow</h3>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Each Raid Arena League season runs for a set period, such as 6 to 8 weeks. This timeline gives players enough time to play their matches, prove their skills, and build rivalries. At the end of each season, the best performers advance to the playoffs or the Champions Stage, where the top competitors battle for the title and prizes.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">After the season concludes, players enjoy a short off-season before the next one begins. This cycle keeps the community active and provides regular opportunities for improvement, storytelling, and recognition.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Rewards and Recognition</h3>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Raid Arena believes in rewarding talent and commitment. Winners and high-performing players receive cash prizes, exclusive digital badges, and public recognition within the community. Beyond monetary rewards, players earn prestige — their names and achievements displayed on the Raid Arena leaderboards and Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Each season also features special awards such as:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md text-gray-400 mb-6">
        <li>Most Valuable Player (MVP)</li>
        <li>Top Scorer / Highest Kill Count</li>
        <li>Best Strategist</li>
        <li>Clan of the Season</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">These recognitions celebrate different aspects of gaming excellence, not just winning, making the experience more inclusive and inspiring for everyone.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Community and Growth</h3>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">The league system is not just about competition — it's also about building a culture. Through the Raid Arena League, players form friendships, clans, and rivalries that extend beyond individual matches. Clans can represent their regions or countries, adding a sense of pride and unity.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">The league format also encourages discipline and teamwork. Players must stay consistent, communicate well, and improve their strategies week by week. It's an environment where gamers can grow — not only in skill but also in professionalism, preparing them for larger esports opportunities in Africa and beyond.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Why the League Format Matters</h3>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">The introduction of the league system is a major step in transforming how mobile esports operates in Ghana and across Africa. Instead of one-time events that fade quickly, leagues provide structure, progression, and identity. Players can build long-term reputations, climb the ranks season after season, and develop their brands as professional competitors.</p>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">Moreover, this format keeps the audience engaged — fans can follow their favorite players or clans throughout the season, celebrate their victories, and anticipate intense rivalries. Just like traditional football leagues, it builds a loyal fan base and consistent excitement</p>
