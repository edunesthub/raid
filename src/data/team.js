        bio: "I am building Africa’s most trusted competitive gaming platform. I founded RaidArena to provide the structured infrastructure African esports deserves.",
        longBio: "Before becoming a founder, I was immersed in Africa’s competitive gaming scene — not as a spectator, but as part of the grind. I witnessed incredibly talented players training daily, sharpening their skills, and dominating matches — yet struggling to find structured tournaments, credible organizers, and guaranteed payouts.\n\nMost competitions lived inside WhatsApp groups and Discord servers. The passion was real. The competition was intense. But the systems weren’t. Talent was never the problem. Infrastructure was.\n\nI saw players win tournaments and still chase organizers for prize money. I saw hosts overwhelmed by manual brackets, disputes, and payment confusion. I saw teams with potential but no visibility, no performance data, and no pathway beyond local recognition.\n\nAt the same time, Africa’s gaming population was growing at an unprecedented rate — yet the ecosystem remained fragmented, informal, and difficult to scale. That realization became a turning point.\n\nWith my background in product design, frontend development, and building digital systems, I understood something fundamental: Africa didn’t need more random tournaments. It needed structured infrastructure — built for its realities.\n\nIn 2025, I founded RaidArena with a clear and ambitious mission: To build Africa’s most trusted competitive gaming platform — where players compete with confidence, hosts organize professionally, teams manage talent efficiently, and prize payouts are secure and transparent.\n\nRaidArena isn’t just another tournament website. It is the operational backbone of competitive gaming in Africa.\n\nToday, RaidArena powers:\n• Structured, scalable tournament hosting\n• Verified match systems and dispute handling\n• Professional team onboarding and management\n• Transparent and accountable prize distribution\n• A competitive ecosystem designed for African gamers\n\nWhat began as frustration has evolved into a platform with purpose — built to give African esports the structure, credibility, and growth pathway it deserves.",
